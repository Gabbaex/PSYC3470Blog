### 1

1.  Be able to make a new .qmd document

yes. - green plus icons or from file menu.

### 2

2.  Be able to render a .qmd document

yes. - through render button.

### 3

3.  Explain the difference between the source editor view and visual editor view in Rstudio.

source view is plain text characters, visual view is rendered form of plain text that's interpreted to a formatted markdown.

### 4

4.  Be able to insert simple markdown plain text (headers, lists, paragraphs), and render the document.

#### This is a header {.unnumbered .unlisted}

-   **test text incoming:**
    -   **regular test of a text** , *regular test of a fancy test*
    -   quick maths: 45^0^ 65^38^ 12^500000^
        -   ~~haha jk~~ `why is this purple`

### 5

5.  Be aware of resources to help you learn more about markdown options.

`![Caption](image.png)`

$insert math equation here$ $x=1$

`grey square maker`

### 6

6.  Be able to insert an R code chunk, and show the output in the rendered document.

-macro for quick insert Running R code chunks in a qmd pressing play copy/paste into console highlight then command-enter (mac) precedence issues (first to last)

`alt + ctrl + i , shortcut to make R space block thingy`

```{r, render="asis"}

cat("hello ")

cat("pressing play runs the chunk into the console")

2+2

```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

1:10
1:5
1:20

```

can highlight portion of code in R chunk, type ctrl + enter to run selected part(s)

syntax for R chunk #\| and press tab to see options for parameters

### 7

7.  Be aware of R code chunk options, and how to use eval, messages, error, warning, and echo.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| error: true
#| out-width: 75%

hist(mtcars$mpg)

"b" + 5

```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(dplyr)
```

### 8

8.  Be able to set code chunk options per chunk, and/or for the whole document. Understand rules for precedence (which options will apply if both are set.)

    yes, using execute in top-level yml - chunk options \> global options

### 9

9.  Write inline r code.

    `r 4+4`

    My weekly MTA fare is `r (2.75+2.75)*2` dollars.

### 10

10. Explain how the rendering environment is different from the Rstudio environment.

```{r}
a <- 50
b <- 100

c <- a+b
```

restarting R restarts the Rstudio environment as new, the rendering environment is its own separate R

### 11

11. Be aware of more advanced quarto options for html documents, and try some of the options. :(
