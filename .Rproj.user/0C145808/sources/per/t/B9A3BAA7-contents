## M1: *Explaining Basic Programming Skills*

# 1 - R objects

> R objects: show that you understand and can create/use objects of various types, including at least: character/string, numeric, integer, logical, data.frame, and list. Show that you can index objects appropriately (e.g., locate elements of an object, change elements of an object etc.)

```{r}
d <- c("Red", "Green", "Blue") #vector with character strings assigned to d
e <- c(0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5) #vector with double numbers assigned to e
f <- c(1,2,3,4,5) #vector with whole numbers/integers assigned to f
g <- c("One", "Two", "Three") #vector with characters assigned to g
h <- e + f #combined values in e & f into new value h

f > e #values in f (1,2,3,4,5) are all individually greater than corresponding values in e (0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5)
d == g #characters Red, Green, Blue are not equal to characters One, Two, Three
h == e + f #value h, which is the combination of numbers in e & f, are equal to values e and f summed

is.numeric(e) #value e is comprised of numbers, so this is true
typeof(e) #value e has all decimals, so this means they classify as double

is.integer(f) #checks if 'f' is an integer, not what is inside f (this confused me so i searched it up)
is.integer(1:5) #numbers 1:5 are the same numbers assigned to f, these are integers so outcome is true

typeof(1:5) #numbers 1 to 5 are whole, integers
 
is.character(d) #the vector assigned to d is comprised of characters, so this is true
is.character(g) #the vector assigned to g also has characters in it, this is true
typeof(TRUE) #uppercase true is a logical statement


#data frame named df and has various colors, corresponding levels, and more colors
df <- data.frame (colors = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"), levels = c(10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0), more_colors = c("firebrick", "chocolate", "gold", "seagreen", "deepskyblue", "magenta"))

df #name of data frame used to print out the data frame created

#list named list1 has the value d, and a vector of characters listed
list1 <- list(d, c("Yellow", "Green", "Purple", "Orange"))
print(list1) #prints the list
```

# 2 - Logical operations

> Logical operations: show that you understand and can use logical operators in R (e.g., == \| \> \< \>= \<=)

```{r}
1 == 1 #1 is equal to 1, this is true
2 == 3 #2 is not equal to 3, this is false
489 != 489 #489 is equal to 489, saying it is not equal to makes this false
245 <= 246 #245 is less than or equal to 246, this is true
g > d #value g is greater than d, the first one isn't and the second and third are, according to r
g < d #value g is less than d, the opposite of above
e >= f #value e's numbers are not greater than nor equal to the numbers in value f
h >= f #value h's numbers are all greater than or equal to the numbers in value f
e + f == h #value e & f combined is equal to the value of h, this is true for all 5 individual numbers
16 %% 4 == 0 | 16 %% 8 == 0 #16 is divisible by 4 with no remainder OR 16 is divisible by 8 with no remainder, this is true
8 %% 2 == 0 & 8 %% 4 == 0 #8 is divisible by 2 with no remainder AND 8 is divisible by 4 with no remainder, which is correct
```

# 3 - Loops

> Loops: Show that you understand the components of a for loop, and that you can use a for loop.

```{r}
j <- c(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0) #vector filled with 0 and 1 assigned to j

#for/if else loop for the iterator in each value of j, if it's equal to 0 print out "zero", if not [else] then print out "one"
for (i in j) {
  if (i == 0) {
    print("zero")
  } else {
    print("one")
  }
}

#for loop for the iterator in value f, do print out each one
for (i in f) {
  print(i)
}

#for loop for x in value j, print out what x is with 2 added to each
for (x in j) {
  print(x + 2)
}
```

# 4 - Functions

> Functions: Show that you understand the syntax for declaring your own function, and that you can declare and run your own custom function to accomplish some task (you choose what the function does).

```{r}
#function created and assigned to f1, stands for 'function one'
#for i in l, i minus 3 is assigned to m, then returns outcome of printing out m
f1 <- function(l) {
  for(i in l) {
    m <- i - 3
    return(print(m))
  }
}

f1(9000) #input for function one, the l becomes 9000

#another function created and assigned to f2, stands for 'function two'
#for i in the range of 33-0, outcome is to print out i minus 3, so each number in range subtracted by 3
f2 <- function() {
  for(i in 33:0) {
    print(i-3)
  }
}

f2() #runs function
```
