Testing - following the tutorial, but not sure how to remove the old image, trying to put a new one. (I also kept the original code that was in the copied post, but changed some numbers - also no sure how that works).

\[Update\]: I didn't know how to put the image in and it wasn't working for a while. However, something I did made it show up now woo!

```{r}
1000 - 7
```
